# Deep Learning Practice Project (Tentative Title)

## Progress
### Phase 1: Prepare Basic Model
 - [x] Finish PNGAN Model
 - [ ] Implement the loss function
 - [ ] Finish the training process
 - [ ] Collect random dataset or use external dataset (find and download)
 - [ ] Download and pre-process the training and testing data
 - [ ] Write the synthesis image generator
 - [ ] Finish the first round training and see the results

### Phase 2: Create a work flow for the whole process
 - [ ] Create a basic data augmentation method
 - [ ] Create a more complex data augmentation method
 - [ ] Create our augmentation method (with trained model)
 - [ ] Create the workflow with limited dataset
 - [ ] Create the workflow with extended dataset

### Phase 3: Finish Experiments and Collect Data
 - [ ] Experiment on 3 methods on limited dataset
 - [ ] Experiment on 3 methods on extended dataset

### Phase 4: Finish an Essay, Readme and run.sh
 - [ ] Abstract
 - [ ] Introduction
 - [ ] Model and Method
 - [ ] Experiments (Dataset, Model Setting, Exp Method, Result)
 - [ ] Conclusion
 - [ ] Readme
 - [ ] Run.sh
