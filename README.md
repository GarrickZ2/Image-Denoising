## Project Description

Image denoising has various applications ranging from consumer electronics to medical imaging devices. Neural methods have enjoyed great success in real noise removal in high-resolution images. However, training complex neural networks often require many clean-noisy image pairs that correctly model the underlying noise distribution. In addition, image denoising is not easily self-supervised due to the complex nature of real-world image noise. Unfortunately, training data for image denoising has been notoriously difficult and expensive to gather, with the most notable denoising datasets being [SIDD](https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/~kamel/sidd/benchmark.php) and [DND](https://noise.visinf.tu-darmstadt.de/). Neither SIDD nor DND are large datasets: SIDD contains 160 scenes with 150 similar clean-noisy image pairs for each scene captured using smartphones, and DND contains 50 clean-noisy image pairs captured using consumer-grade cameras.

Data augmentation methods in training neural networks have been proven to help improve the robustness of a model by increasing the diversity in data. Surprisingly, data augmentation in generating synthetic noisy training data has been quite tricky because real-world noise cannot be easily approximated. Naive approaches such as adding *additive white Gaussian noise* (AWGN) usually do not help improve the model performance because real-world noise is fundamentally a different distribution than Gaussian.

[Brooks et al.](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Brooks_Unprocessing_Images_for_Learned_Raw_Denoising_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf) and [Zamir et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.07761.pdf) proposed noise-synthesizing methods that attempts to generate realistic noise by first converting an RGB image to a RAW image, before a non-neural RAW noise model is applied and the image is converted back to RGB. 

Taking it one step further, [Cai et al.](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Wua2zjxJdYo) took a neural approach to realistic noise modeling and achieved impressive and ground-breaking results. They proposed a GAN architecture, namely PNGAN. They train a generator that learns to generate real noise from AWGN and a discriminator that distinguishes between real and synthetic noise. Cai et al. trained their GAN using real-noisy training data (SIDD and DND) and generated synthetic noisy-clean image pairs from high-resolution image datasets, including [DIV2K](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/) and [Flickr2K](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w12/papers/Lim_Enhanced_Deep_Residual_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf). They finetuned existing denoising models using a mixture of real-noisy data and synthetic-noisy data and observed noticeable improvements.

Based on this finding, we hypothesied that most current complex denoising models are under-trained due to the scarcity of training data. And the objective of this project is to implement (from scatch) the noise-synthesizing neural networks proposed by Cai et al. and generate realistic noisy training data to better improve existing denoising models, namely [Restormer](https://github.com/swz30/Restormer) proposed by [Zamir et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.09881.pdf), which was trained using only real noisy data (SIDD). We have since observed improved denoising performance in our finetuned Restormer model.

## Example and Results

To train our PNGAN models, we applied similar hyper-parameter settings provided by Cai et al. We trained both the generator and denoiser using the SIDD dataset. For synthetic noise settings, we used the setting1 proposed by the paper. We used the same 128x128 patch setting provided by Cai et al. We trained the model using a batch size of 8 for 60,000 iterations using Adam optimizer and cosine annealing learning rate scheduler with the same learning rate setting. All the models are trained on a single NVIDIA V100 GPU. The following figure shows an example of synthetic noise generation.

</p>

To generate synthetic clean-noisy image pairs for denoiser finetuning, we selected the [DIV2K](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/) dataset, which is a dataset composed of diverse 2k-resolution high quality images which we consider relatively noise-free. From DIV2K, we cropped the high-resolution images to 128x128 patches and feed them through PNGAN generator to gather noisy input. We then mixed the synthetic-noisy (DIV2K-PNGAN) data with real-noisy (SIDD) data to finetune the [pretrained Restormer model](https://github.com/swz30/Restormer). We used the same AdamW optimizer provided by Restormer, and we finetuned the Restormer model for 100,800 iterations using a batch size of 4 due to the memory constraint. The following figure shows an example of the Restormer denoiser.

</p>

In benchmarks, we observed encouraging results in applying PNGAN's synthetic noisy data to finetune the Restormer denoising model. Overall, we observed meaningful performance increase in both PSNR (peak signal-to-noise ratio) and SSIM (structural simmilarity index measure) after finetuning Restormer with PNGAN-noise. To prove the effectiveness of our noise model, we also included benchmarks of the model finetuned with Gaussian noise augmented data, which shows that Gaussian noise augmentation actually degrades the performance of the original denoising model, suggesting that real noise distribution cannot be approximated with simple Gaussian noise.

## FineTune Restormer

### Finetune Restormer Denoiser with Real and PNGAN Noisy Images

First, follow the [installation instruction](https://github.com/swz30/Restormer/blob/main/INSTALL.md) provided by the official Restormer authors to install the depenedencies required to run Restormer.



Download the official pre-trained Restormer [models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Qwsjyny54RZWa7zC4Apg7exixLBo4uF0?usp=sharing) and place them in `./Restormer/Denoising/pretrained_models/`. Optionally, you can also download the data from shell or notebook using the mirror we provided:

```bash
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/yy3185/real_denoising.pth -O ./Restormer/Denoising/pretrained_models/real_denoising.pth
```



Download the training and validation data. We are using 128x128 RGB images.

```bash
# These commands, along with the following commands, must run in the Restormer directory
cd ./Restormer/

# Download and unzip real-noisy and fake-noisy training data, and real-noisy validation data
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/yy3185/SIDD_train_patches.zip
unzip -q SIDD_train_patches.zip -d ./Denoising/

wget https://storage.googleapis.com/yy3185/SIDD_val_patches.zip
unzip -q SIDD_val_patches.zip -d ./Denoising/

wget https://storage.googleapis.com/yy3185/PNGAN_train.zip
unzip -q PNGAN_train.zip -d ./Denoising/

# Copy all real-noisy and fake-noisy training data to one folder
mkdir -p ./Denoising/Datasets/train/PNGAN+SIDD/input_crops/
mkdir -p ./Denoising/Datasets/train/PNGAN+SIDD/target_crops/

cp -r ./Denoising/Datasets/train/PNGAN/input_crops/ ./Denoising/Datasets/train/PNGAN+SIDD/input_crops/
cp -r ./Denoising/Datasets/train/SIDD/input_crops/ ./Denoising/Datasets/train/PNGAN+SIDD/input_crops/
cp -r ./Denoising/Datasets/train/PNGAN/target_crops/ ./Denoising/Datasets/train/PNGAN+SIDD/target_crops/
cp -r ./Denoising/Datasets/train/SIDD/target_crops/ ./Denoising/Datasets/train/PNGAN+SIDD/target_crops/
```



Run the training command to start the training process. Please note that most of the configuration parameters are specified in the configuration YAML file (e.g., number of steps, learning rate, batch size, metrics, etc.), so you may read the YAML file to find more. You may also change them to run correctly in your compute (e.g., configure the number of GPUs).

```bash
python train.py -opt ./Denoising/Options/PNGANRealDenoising_Restormer.yml --pretrained_weights ./Denoising/pretrained_models/real_denoising.pth
```



Then you may evaluate using the following script.

```bash
python evaluate.py -opt ./Denoising/Options/PNGANRealDenoising_Restormer.yml --pretrained_weights ./experiment/PNGANRealDenoising_Restormer/models/net_g_latest.pth
```

### Finetune Restormer Denoiser with Real and Gaussian Noisy Images

As part of our ablation studies, we explore finetuning Restormer on the task of real noise denoising with data augmentation using simple Gaussian noise (as opposed to noise modeled by PNGAN). We generated additional clean-noise image pairs for training, by applying Gaussian noise ($\sigma=15$) on the [DIV2K](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/) high-resolution image dataset.

```bash
# Download the additional training data
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/yy3185/Gaussian_train.zip
unzip -q Gaussian_train.zip -d ./Denoising/

# Copy the data to the training folder
mkdir -p ./Denoising/Datasets/train/Gaussian+SIDD/input_crops/
mkdir -p ./Denoising/Datasets/train/Gaussian+SIDD/target_crops/

cp -r ./Denoising/Datasets/train/Gaussian/input_crops/ ./Denoising/Datasets/train/Gaussian+SIDD/input_crops/
cp -r ./Denoising/Datasets/train/SIDD/input_crops/ ./Denoising/Datasets/train/Gaussian+SIDD/input_crops/
cp -r ./Denoising/Datasets/train/Gaussian/target_crops/ ./Denoising/Datasets/train/Gaussian+SIDD/target_crops/
cp -r ./Denoising/Datasets/train/SIDD/target_crops/ ./Denoising/Datasets/train/Gaussian+SIDD/target_crops/
```



Run the training command as follows:

```bash
python train.py -opt ./Denoising/Options/GaussianRealDenoising_Restormer.yml --pretrained_weights ./Denoising/pretrained_models/real_denoising.pth
```



Evaluate using the following command:

```bash
python evaluate.py -opt ./Denoising/Options/GaussianRealDenoising_Restormer.yml --pretrained_weights ./experiment/GaussianRealDenoising_Restormer/models/net_g_latest.pth
```

## Test Finetuned Restormer

To establish our baseline, we show the performance of the pre-trained Restormer denoiser on the [SIDD real-noisy dataset](https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/~kamel/sidd/dataset.php). The original evaluation [script](https://github.com/swz30/Restormer/blob/main/Denoising/evaluate_sidd.m) calls for Matlab, but we provided a Python alternative.

To prepare data, download and unzip the SIDD eval dataset.

```bash
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/yy3185/SIDD_val_patches.zip
unzip -q SIDD_val_patches.zip -d ./Denoising/
```

Then, download the the official pre-trained Restormer [checkpoint](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Qwsjyny54RZWa7zC4Apg7exixLBo4uF0?usp=sharing) and place them in `./Restormer/Denoising/pretrained_models/`
    - Optionally, you can also download the data from shell or notebook using the mirror we provided:

```bash
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/yy3185/real_denoising.pth -O ./Restormer/Denoising/pretrained_models/real_denoising.pth
```

Then you may evaluate using the following script.

```bash
python evaluate.py -opt ./Denoising/Options/RealDenoising_Restormer.yml --pretrained_weights ./Denoising/pretrained_models/real_denoising.pth
```

## Contribution
1. Implement the PNGAN code, train the model and provide our pretrained models on GitHub. Provide easy scripts for others to re-run.

2. Provide a method to conduct data augmentation with less confidential images for fine-tuning a model.

3. Provide a solution (flask parameter server ) and codes for students (lack computation power) to corroborate GPU between Google Colab sessions. The server is robust and easy to configure.

4. We fine-tuned the restormer and successfully improved the performance. We proved that our assumption of a lack data training and our data augmentation method is valid.
